# Setting up Android Development Environment

## Introduction
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. This document provides a step-by-step guide to installing and setting up Android Studio on your machine.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System:** Android Studio is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required for downloading Android Studio and necessary components.
- **System Requirements:** Refer to the [official Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) for minimum system requirements.

## Step 1: Download Android Studio
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [official Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Click on the "Download Android Studio" button.
3. Choose the appropriate download for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to download the installer file.

## Step 2: Install Android Studio
1. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded installer file (e.g., `android-studio-ide-<version>.exe` for Windows, `android-studio-ide-<version>.dmg` for macOS, or `android-studio-ide-<version>.tar.gz` for Linux).
2. Double-click the installer file to launch the Android Studio Setup Wizard.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions in the Setup Wizard to complete the installation process.
4. Choose the installation location and any additional components you wish to install (e.g., Android Virtual Device).
5. Click "Finish" to complete the installation.

## Step 3: Configure Android Studio
1. Launch Android Studio by double-clicking its icon on the desktop or from the installed location.
2. If prompted, choose whether to import settings from a previous version of Android Studio or start with default settings.
3. Android Studio will then download and install additional components, such as the Android SDK and necessary dependencies. This process may take some time depending on your internet connection speed.

## Step 4: Create a New Project
1. Once Android Studio is fully set up, click on the "Start a new Android Studio project" option on the welcome screen.
2. Follow the New Project Wizard to configure your project settings, including project name, package name, and minimum SDK version.
3. Choose the desired template for your project (e.g., "Empty Activity" or "Basic Activity") and click "Finish" to create the project.

## Step 5: Start Developing
1. Android Studio is now set up and ready for development.
2. Explore the various features and tools provided by Android Studio, including the layout editor, code editor, and debugging tools.
3. Refer to official Android developer documentation and tutorials to learn more about Android app development using Android Studio.

## Step 6: Connect Physical Device
1. Connect your physical Android device to your machine using a USB cable.
2. Ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device. You can enable it in the Developer options section of your device's settings.

## Step 7: Run the Project on the Physical Device
1. In Android Studio, select your physical device from the list of available devices in the toolbar.
2. Click on the "Run" button (green play icon) in the toolbar or go to "Run" > "Run 'app'" from the top menu.
3. Android Studio will build the project and deploy it to your physical device.
4. Once the deployment is complete, the app will automatically launch on your device, and you can interact with it as you would with any other app.

## Step 8: Troubleshooting
- If the physical device is not detected, ensure that USB debugging is enabled and that the necessary device drivers are installed on your machine.
- If there are any errors during the build or deployment process, refer to the Android Studio console for error messages and troubleshooting steps.
